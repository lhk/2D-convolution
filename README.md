# 2D-convolution
The batch_conv file is the final version. It parallelizes the convolution along a batch.
It also contains comments to explain the procedure step by step.

The conv_nocolors file implements a very simple first prototype where the image has just one color.
The conv notebook expands this to more than one input and output color.
